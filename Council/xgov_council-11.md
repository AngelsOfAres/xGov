 ## Introduction
 
 I am applying to join the xGov council for the purpose of serving the community with responsible decisions that aim to steer Algorand towards long-term success. I have been part of the Algorand community dating back to late 2020, and have held Algo ever since first discovering the chain. I have no affiliation with any project in Algorand, and I am largely running because I see some people running who are. I am a truly independant actor and promise to post a twitter a discussion, and a poll to the community to gauge responses and hope to learn more points of view from any proposal that I am asked to vote for. I cannot gurantee that the outcome of the poll or discussion will 100% decide my answer, but my goal here is to make the most informed decision for the community.
 
 # What I Will Vote For
My goal is to vote for improvements to the algorand ecosystem that do not only serve certain participants in the Algorand community, but not others. All of my support will go to long term solutions that are aimed at improving the continued success, functionality, capability, and attractiveness for Algorand as the future of finance. Proposals that do not meet this requirement, will be voted down.
 
 Examples
 - Open source tools that can be used by any algorand user
 - Bounty programs that improve community tools
 - Cross-chain (interoporability) growth
 - Furthering decentralization of nodes/relay nodes

# What I Will NOT Fot
I will not vote for proposals that favor a specific market participant over another, and I will not vote for any initiatives that are short-term or price-focused.

Examples:
- NFT Community Funding
- Rewards for using a specific company's platforms such as AlgoFi, or Humble for instance. All competitors should compete in a free market without community rewards supporting them
- Changes to tokenomics
- Funds for partnerships
- I will not vote for anything rewards to be given for something BEFORE it is built (paid upon receipt of work complete)
- Proposals aimed to boost the price of algorand short term
 
 
 ## Social Profiles

 ## Relevant Experience
 I currently work for a software startup, building lending and deposit products in Tradfi for the last 3 years. Previous experience, 6 years as a Product Manager at a large Credit Union, and 3 years at the investment bank at JP Morgan. While never officially working in Crypto, I have been a long time member of the Bitcoin Community (2014) and Algorand (2020). If you are not familiar with me, you can track my Algorand Forums profile and view any posts and comments I've made on there. (https://forum.algorand.org/u/conscious/summary) I have also been very active in the Algorand Twitter and Discord community.)
 
 ## Projects Affiliation
 
 None, personally I think this is a benefit for a position like this.
 
 ## Additional Information

 I just would like the community to know that despite me not being extremely well-known or vocal in the community in terms of projects or working directly in the space, doesnt mean that I have not paid attention and thought deeply about the problems in both the algorand space, and the crypto space. I think I was the only person who I met at Decipher-Dubai who had no affiliation directly to a project or was monetizing anything in the space. I was simply there because I believe in the system. I also attended (at Decipher Dubai) a critical discussion with folks like Massimo/Adri about the future of governance in 2022, and understand how deeply complicated but important correctly utilizing governance as a mechanism to decide the future of the blockchain is. For references, I have met several key figures in the community such as fisherman.algo, mj.algo, crypto0forchange.algo, coop.algo, and I believe they would all vouch for me as someone who is passionate about algorand and someoone who just genuinely wants to see algorand succeed for the right reasons.
