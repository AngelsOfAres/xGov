## Introduction

Explain why you are applying to become an xGov council member. What motivates you to participate in the review process? Highlight how your involvement can contribute to the ecosystem.

I discovered Algorand in 2020 and fell in love with the tech, the people and the UX. I've explored many other chains and ecosystems and haven't found anything like Algorand. I love this chain. I want the absolute best for it and it's users.
