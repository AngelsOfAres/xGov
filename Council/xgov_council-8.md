## Introduction

Hey Algofam, many of you may recognize me from around the ecosystem. I've been a part of Algorand since 2020, am a full stack developer, and building my brand AoA on Algorand. I believe I have the necessary skill set to be a great addition to the council, as I have extensive knowledge of the Algorand ecosystem from DeFi to NFTs to dApps to community, you name it. I have a Bachelor in Electrical Engineering and daytrade for a living.

As part of the council, I would serve to the best of my ability in pushing the space forward, dedicating my time and effort to diligently covering my tasks and beyond. Thank your for the consideration.

## Relevant Experience

I have been extensively trading and participating in the ecosystem since 2020, I own or have owned hundreds of wallets with tens of millions of transactions, verifiable on chain. During my time on Algorand, I have tried most dApps, including our various DeFi suites, staking platforms, NFT marketplaces, Discord games, tools, and everything in between.

I am also a full stack developer. Below are examples of apps I've built:

Websites:
- Fallen Order MMORPG - https://fallenorder.xyz
- Samurai - https://samurai.angelsofares.xyz
- Creator Tools - https://fallenorder.xyz/tools

Discord Bots:
- 6 bots for Fallen Order to handle the game
- Funman, built as a free service for Algorand projects to provide community activities to their servers
- Voiman, built as a free service for projects on Voi, however we decided to not pursue a path into Voi as it has an extremely centralized nature compared to Algorand
- Ninjaman, a bot that monitors the Rug Ninja platform on-chain and reports all related activities to Discord in realtime
- Swapman, a bot that monitors the network block by block and reports and swaps made via dexes directly to Discord in realtime

## Additional Information

There are many great candidates out there for a council position, and I wholeheartedly believe I match that criteria to serve Algorand well and provide support where needed.

I bring a wide variety of knowledge to the table, have various connections across the ecosystem, am building on Algorand, and intend to continue learning and growing with the network.

I appreciate this opportunity and thank you for giving this proposal a glance!
