## Introduction

Hi everyone, I’m applying for the position on the council to help xGov evolve into a functional and beneficial tool for funding public goods in the Algorand ecosystem.
As someone who participated in the early xGov pilot, my motivation extends beyond that experience—I aim to ensure there is no exploitation or malicious activity, as we’ve seen in the past.
I’ve been actively involved with xGov since its first iterations and have consistently been vocal about potential issues or attack vectors targeting it, which reflects my genuine motivation and goals for the program.

## Relevant Experience

I'm a full-stack developer by trade who turned crypto founder in 2021, proudly wearing all the hats that come with the role.
I believe that my technical knowledge, combined with my experience as a Web3 project founder within the Algorand ecosystem, gives me a unique perspective with insights specific to this space that would greatly benefit the proposal evaluation process.

## Projects Affiliation

## Additional Information

In the past i've been actively promoting and helping onboard Algorand projects to get involved with xgov program. I've participated in twitter spaces, attended x-gov workshop at Decipher and have also on many occasions discussed it in-person with builders from ecosystem as-well as Algorand foundation employees.
Previous activity on Algorand forums (most of my posts are xGov-related; however, I’ve also been active in general governance-related topics)
