## Abstract
Gaming will onboard the next big wave of users to Algorand. As one of the oldest and biggest games on algorand we are uniquely positioned to to carry lions share of that influx. Our recent nomination for best blockchain game of 2023 is a good indicator of that. 

To help establish the narrative that Algorand is great for gaming it is crucial that lead games are secure, performant and ideally built to appeal the masses (e.g. actually fun to play) - all of which Cosmic Champs is!

To date, we are the only game that supports real time 3d PVP, with authoritative servers (more secure) on Algorand. This increased security and performance - which are both crucial as they implicity represent Algorand itself (to an uneducated user, a buggy or slow game experience can easily be turned into misconception that Algorand is buggy and slow) are incuring high infrastructure costs for our project and our platform. 

To meet the increasing userbase and be prepared for future influx on gamers, we need to migrate our server fleet to a more powerful instances that will be able to handle sudden spikes in active game sessions better. Xgov grant will help us to maintain the industry standard performance without introducing friction to the new people entering Algorand ecosystem for the intermediate time until we reach critical mass to become profitable.

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
Blockchain Gaming will onboard the next big wave of users to Algorand. As one of the oldest and biggest games on algorand we are uniquely positioned to to carry lions share of that influx. To date, we are the only game that supports real time 3d PVP, with authoritative servers (more secure) on Algorand. This increased security and performance - which are both crucial as they implicity represent Algorand itself (to an uneducated user) are incuring high infrastructure costs for our project and our platform. 

To meet the increasing userbase and be prepared for future influx on gamers, we need to migrate our server fleet to a more powerful instances that will be able to handle sudden spikes in active game sessions better.

Xgov grant will help us to maintain the industry standard performance without introducing friction to the new people entering Algorand ecosystem for the intermediate time until we reach critical mass to become profitable.

The funds will be allocated 50% to our AWS account where we are subscribing our server fleet which we scale to meet the demand with increasing user base. We are happy to take/convert to AWS credits to ensure the funds are locked for this particular use.

The other 50% will be allocated towards dev work involved with migrating the fleet and updating the server code as well as to cover other costs such as Certificates, subscriptions and non-AWS infrastructure for next 6 months (we try to disperse our infrastructure(within reason) so we don't have a single point of failure).

To date we have built and maintaned entire Cosmic champs platform (android + ios + browser game, 4 utility web pages and 2 seasons of innovative fully animated 3d game-ready AR compatibile NFTs) on our own (and VC) funding, we weren't recipient of any of the $8MM+ in grants that were allocated to the "algorand gaming" scene by the foundation neither have we received direct investment from them, yet we can easily be considered benchmark in the space.

We are hopefull xgovs will recognize our contribution and value we bring to the ecosystem and will support our endeavours to ensure we remain on top of our game and fully prepared for the upcomming bull.

Deliverables:
- updating the server fleet and our codebase to support more powerfull instances that that can each support up to 6 concurent game sessions(12 player sessions)
- purchasing AWS credits with 50% of the allocated grant, ensuring uptime and availablility of our game even during high stress, high spike, situations
- We can privide AWS credits bill and game metrics during high stress events to showcase the update and it's impact on the overall game experience.
Timeframe:
- We will try and complete the migration within 2 months upon receiving the funding.

We are asking for 100% of the grant to be available in advance as we would like to pay our devs for the work involved and to ensure we have enough AWS credits to actually pay for higher cost infrastructure that we'll migrate to.

## Future Blueprint
In the future, with increased userbase, we plan to become profitable as soon as possible to ensure the platform can keep meeting and exceeding the needs of algorand(and wider) gaming scene.

## Benefits for the community
Imagine a bad Algorand Wallet, if that wallet is slow and buggy(or hacked) people simply assume that is Algorands fault. To enforce the narrative that Algorand is great for gaming it is crucial that games are secure, performant and ideally built to appeal the masses - all of which Cosmic Champs is!

To date, we are the only game that supports real time 3d PVP, with authoritative servers (more secure) on Algorand. This increased security and performance are both crucial as they implicity represent Algorand itself (to an unedeucated user). Our game is also inspired by one of the most successfull mobile games of all time, using a proven model with very wide audience appeal and huge potential for mass adoption.

Cosmic Champs has been recognized with a nomination for the best blockchain game of 2023 by PlayToEarn. This nomination is a testament to the gameâ€™s impact and potential in the blockchain gaming community. Even more so as we were the only Algorand game that was nominated. 

We are constantly looking for new ways how to empower other Algorand projects (cross community NFT collabs, branded prize bots in our game) so they can benefit from our exposure and success and vice-versa.

Recently we've seen Blockchains or L2 solutions that heavily focus on gaming constantly topping the charts on dapradar, by either UAW or tx count - simply because gaming is sich a huge market. Algorand's tech is perfect fit, let's push this the narrative together.
