## Abstract

Algorand lacks a proper service for launching new tokens. People has to make airdrops by hand, can't get proper liquidity, etc. 

Recent explosion of Base and Solana ecosystems was fully because they had a proper mechanisms to launch tokens. With decent platform we'll easily attract people from other chains to do the same on Algorand.

Cometa has already helped a lot of small projects to get liquidity as well as media attention. Launchpad is the most suitable, logical and GENIUS addition to the platform.

## Experience with Algorand

Cometa started on Algorand in 2021 with <b>3D AR</b> NFT collection <b>Metapunks</b>. We:
* First <b>NFT random shuffle</b> app on Algorand. With that we won <b>Innovative Hackaton 2021</b> in Digital Art/Collectibles Challenge https://developer.algorand.org/articles/innovate-hackathon-2021/.
* First <b>true web3 staking algorithm</b> on Algorand with <b>open-sourcing</b> of those <b>Reach</b> smart-contracts: https://github.com/MetaLabsOG/cometa-lm-contract.
* Minor features like locked pools, Compound feature, DEX aggregator powered by <b>Deflex</b>, proper API to get all the platform stats.
* Runner-up winner of <b>Decipher 2022</b> main pitch competition in Dubai with Liquidity-as-a-Service concept (working on testnet).
* Running own Algorand Node (soon open for user staking for consensus), using JS & Python SDKs, building own tools.

## Present Proposal

Initial Launchpad features:
- Create a token.
- Funding pool, where users stake ALGO/(other pay asset), and those ALGOs go straight to token liquidity and optionally LOCKED. The more people stake, the higher the price. 
- Pool for just selling tokens, where the fixed amount of tokens are put, and users fill the pool, affecting the price.
- Tool for airdrop by specified conditions (NFD segments, NFTs holders, ASA holders, Cometa Pool Stakers, etc.)

### Technical specifications

We already have a contract for selling, need to test it. Other then that:
- Developing smart contract for auto liquidity provision and locking.
- Creating a proper design.
- Building UX to set up the pools and to show them.
- Tools for airdropping and simple interface.

## Future Blueprint

Currently Cometa focused on helping small and middle sized projects to get liqudity and attention. With the Launchpad we're leveraging that attracting new users and gathering much more funds.

Bringing memecoins to the next level, which is sadly the current engine of progress for any DeFi. It will attract people from other chains now that they have an easy instrument.

## Benefits for the community

- Easily create, sell, distribute and get liquidity for your token, with just a few clicks.

- Increasing quality of projects and tokens, because now project have time to actually think about token value and utility and not about how to launch and promote it.

- Transparency for buyers. All info, prices and mechanisms in one place, easy to get what is legit and what is not.

## Additional information

You know Cometa. We just buildin.
