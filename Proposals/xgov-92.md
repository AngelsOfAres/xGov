## Abstract

**DAOsign: Workflow Orchestration platform built on decentralized Smart Signature protocol**

DAOsign is a decentralized and customizable platform where collaboration, authorization, and workflow management are facilitated through cryptographic proofs stored on a blockchain

Verifiable Signature is at the core of DAOsign and is based on 3 key proofs: proof-of-identify, proof-of-authority, and proof-of-agreement. Utilizing these proofs, DAOsign provides a platform to design and configure complex workflows that combine smart-contract-based automation with authorized approvals.

**Problem:** Outdated Electronic Signatures Technologies
Traditional electronic signatures are lack security and transparency, susceptible to compromise and forgery, with no unified system for robust verification.

**Solution:** DAOsign Smart Signature
DAOsign introduces cryptographic, decentralized signature standard, a technologically advanced alternative to traditional e-signatures, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain. This technology aims to establish a global standard for secure and verifiable digital signatures, ensuring integrity across borders, legal jurisdictions, and administrative systems.

## Experience with Algorand

While our team may not have prior experience with Algorand, we are excited to embark on this journey due to its many advantages in terms of scalability, efficiency, and security. We are well-versed in building applications and understanding the fundamentals of decentralized applications, and we look forward to utilizing our skills to contribute to the Algorand ecosystem. Our eagerness to explore Algorand's capabilities and leverage its technology is driven by the immense potential we see for enhancing agreement management and smart signature solutions on this innovative blockchain.

## Present Proposal
We want to build our DAOsign tool on the Algorand blockchain, so the users can store and verify proofs there. Furthermore, DAOsign provides a robust Governance and Policy Builder platform to provide governance, workflow automation, and controls for organization policies and procedures. Our project aims to revolutionize agreement management with decentralized, verifiable, and secure technology. We have prepared the use cases specifically for the grant committees, who are interested in automating and securing their grant selection and management workflow.

## Future Blueprint
| Milestones # | Description | Deliverable | Completion Date | Funding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Milestone 1 | Algorand Testnet Version | The ability to store proofs on the Algorand Testnet blockchain and verify them there. The functionality includes: “Create an agreement” implementation; Assigning signers and observers Implementation of Proof-of-Authority Implementation of Proof-of-Signature Implementation of Proof-of-Agreement. Early adopters program preparation | Q2 2024 | 200,000 |
| Milestone 2 | Incentivized Testnet version | Early Adopters Program launch Online onboarding events Feedback collecting Roadmap adjustment | Q2 2024 | 20,000 |
| Milestone 3 | Mainnet version | Launching blockchain-stored and verified proofs version of DAOsign. Production support System resiliency NFT-based Signer Authority Verification System | Q3 2024 | 50,000 |


## Benefits for the community
DAOsign can fit into this ecosystem by providing a platform for DAOs to manage their decision-making processes in a decentralized manner. Our target audience is not only DAOs but also all the companies, that need to deal with agreement/policies management including the use case for managing Grants.

DAOsign will streamline the process of creating and executing legal agreements and contracts within the Algorand ecosystem, which will greatly improve the overall user experience making it more user-friendly and secure.

Also, the DAOsign tool will enhance governance processes within the Algorand ecosystem. Users can use it to formalize governance proposals, voting, and decision-making, improving transparency and efficiency.

The example of the use case for foundation purposes, which describes how Algorand can benefit from the DAOsign tool can be found here: https://docsend.com/view/sbexkxn5su3ahdg8

## Additional information
Currently, our product is on Testnet. DAOsign already allows users to store proofs of signature in the IPFS, Ethereum launch is planned in the nearest time. Also, recently, we received grants from SUI and Polkadot, so DAOsign users will be able to use these blockchains for proofs storing purposes soon as well. Our team is working on expanding the number of use cases (we would be happy to tell you more about that during the call, if appropriate). Furthermore, recently we signed our first commercial project with a logistics grain company.
