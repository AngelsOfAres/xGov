## Abstract
This proposal has been highly requested from app developers on Discord and Telegram. Here users will be able to use new API endpoints to easily create automated swap links. This will help reduce the onboarding friction of having to add an ASA to claim something as the atomic swap will have the opt in and transfer in once signing. In addition to creating the ability for bots to tap into the website, we will be developing an example discord bot to make things easier to develop and have a manual swap creation feature, becuase why not? 

## Team
The team at Thurstober Digital Studios (xGov Periods 1 and 2 Awardees):

LoafPickle - Project Manager. I have 10 years of Project Management experience working in NYC on large scale construction projects. In addition, I am a long timer in the Algorand NFT Space and have been helping develop utility projects on the chain since May 2021. I am currently the Head of Strategy and Community for Thurstober Digital Studios. 

ByKewel - Tool Developer. Kewel is another Algorand NFT long timer that was the first to create wallet holding, sales, and listing discord bots that projects were able to incorporate into the ecosysytem. They also built the first on-chain DAO tool back in February 2022. 

Jenna (thurstober) - Project Lead.

Andrew (stablehand) - Lead Developer

## Experience with Algorand
All of us have been in the Algorand NFT Space since May 2021. Thurstober Digital Studios has built a full horse racing utility series and our body of work with The Laboratory (Formerly Evil Tools) speaks for itself.

## Present Proposal
A new claims landing page where URL Parameters can be created so people can claim atomic swaps. This was something that was previously in the ecosystem and helped reduce the opt in friction. 

In this package, we will support a way for people to create their own atomic swaps and share the link. In addition discord bots and other external sources can tap into the site to create swapable links to create marketplaces or redemptions on the go. 

No more need to opt into things manually when this tool can be used to opt in and claim. 

## Future Blueprint
Build it. 

## Benefits for the community
The benefits are already being realized. When the myalgo hack went down, we quickly created mass add and send tools with Pera integration so creators and collectors alike were able to efficiently move their assets to safe homes. Since then, we have creators thanking us for providing them the tools we wish we had back in the early days of Algorand NFTs.

## Additional information
We had been approved in the first and second xGov Round to build more tools. The tools have since been completed and made open source.

In addition to the tooling, we also provide creator guides that allow new creators to get a lay of the ecosystem to help the onboarding experience. You can find them here: https://medium.com/@loafpickle
