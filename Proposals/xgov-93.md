## Abstract
Gaming and tournament play is a powerful vehicle for attracting new users. A free entry tournament with BIG prize pool allows us to promote to and attract users from wider crypto ecosystem as well as more conventional gaming audience.
Our game requires algorand wallet, so each new participant from these communities will directly translate into a new Algorand user. We've hosted multiple tournaments in the past with very positive results you can read a detailed report here: <a href="https://medium.com/cosmic-champs/tournament-wrap-up-d1b5d8ff8713">https://medium.com/cosmic-champs/tournament-wrap-up-d1b5d8ff8713</a>

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
We will host a free entry tournament to showcase the game we are building and attract new users to our game and the Algorand ecosystem. Gaming is a powerful vehicle for attracting new users. A large pool of prizes would help promote the tournament and excite crypto gamers outside of Algorand.
We will promote the tournament through our broader network of partners and will provide plenty of rewards from our side.

We are building a real-time, tower defence, web3, mobile game that has a fun and exciting user experience. The game is currently accessible on Android and iOS devices via a mobile app and PC via a web browser.
