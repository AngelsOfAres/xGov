## Abstract
The purpose for this grant is providing a mechanism for establishing a culture of ethics and compliance for projects on Algorand. 
The focus for this work will center around U.S. securities compliance, providing new resources for structuring Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) to ensure regulatory compliance. 
This software will add value to Algorand by: 1) helping to reduce regulatory risk; 2) reducing the risk of litigation or increasing the probability of success in the event of a class action lawsuit; and 3) help to streamline efficiency in the development of new assets in accordance with U.S. Law and create a more ethical and corporate culture on the Algorand network.

## Present Proposal



Regulators nor legislators have any incentive to create clear rules or guidance for innovative or decentralized markets. As a result, asset creators are in a difficult position, where there are only two ways they can follow U.S. securities law. The first is to spend a lot of time and capital up front to create a security token and register the asset with the SEC. 
This first option simply isn't possible for most new projects that lack the capital to hire legal counsel and pay SEC registration fees, as well as the time to wait for the SEC to register an asset. 

The second way to follow the law is to engineer assets which are not securities and therefore not within the SEC's jurisdiction of regulation. This option comes with some drawbacks for new projects, however this is the only option in many circumstances due to the high cost of registration for small businesses and the nature of decentralized digital assets and applications. Moreover, this option focuses more on utility and applications which will help to grow value over time with the success of an underlying product.

The goal is creating a culture of compliance, which is critical on Algorand to ensure value is captured in as cost-efficient manner as possible. Our solution, Choice Coin Compliance AI is an embedded system which formalizes human knowledge using natural language processing to statistically measure the probability that a particular asset is a security. The technology statistically measures digital assets on a scale of 0 to 1, where an asset with a score of 0 is almost certain to be considered a security and an asset with a score of 1 is almost certainly not a security. 

The goal for this software is to help asset creators on Algorand that do not wish create security tokens, engineer their assets to reduce regulatory risk and comply with the law. Compliance protocols helps projects to reduce regulatory risk, promote professionalism, and stimulate cost-efficient business practices. For example, this work can help ASAs get listed on exchanges, which are scared to list assets which may be securities. In turn, these same benefits carry over to the layer-1 protocols on which projects are built, such as Algorand. 

Our solution is a confluence of software and professional services for automating compliance for projects on Algorand, with the overall offering as compliance as a service. The Solution includes a software as a service product, a compliance AI web application, where projects can pay to access the data and generate a compliance report. 
In other words, Choice Coin is inventing a Compliance AI for automating securities compliance. In fact, the first part of our solution is already in development and has had successful responses from preliminary customers.

The goal for this software is to help asset creators that do not wish create security tokens, engineer their assets to reduce regulatory risk of the SEC inappropriately labeling a non-security asset as a security. The Compliance AI will use an embedded system to formalize expert knowledge to provide an automated regulatory risk assessment. The technology will also be used to generate a compliance report for customers and be integrated with the Algorand blockchain through a web-application.

Whether an asset is a security or non-security asset depends on various actors analyzing certain attributes associated with the asset. This software defines the analysis using defined variables, which may be weighted and processed for producing probabilistic measurements. The probabilistic measurements correspond with a number between 0 and 1, where an asset with a score of 1 is statistically unlikely to be a security and an asset with a score of 0 is likely to be a security. 



Moreover, the Compliance AI will be structured, such that various reporting data are sent to and stored on the Algorand blockchain.

The Choice Coin compliance offering has three main pillars: 
  (1) a legal database with regulatory and legal data, such as cases, published law review articles, and regulatory texts; 
  (2) a software for automation, which is open source and iteratively improved; and 
  (3) human experts providing and developing the services and associated products.

### Future Blue Print



## Benefits for the community

Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: By funding the Choice Coin Compliance AI proposal, the Algorand community can contribute to enhancing regulatory compliance within the ecosystem. The Compliance AI software will provide asset creators on Algorand with automated tools and resources to assess the regulatory status of their digital assets accurately. This proactive approach to compliance not only reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions but also fosters a culture of responsibility and professionalism within the Algorand community. Ultimately, enhanced regulatory compliance can attract more institutional investors, exchanges, and businesses to the Algorand ecosystem, driving broader adoption and sustainable growth.

Increased Market Access and Liquidity: Funding the Choice Coin Compliance AI proposal can lead to increased market access and liquidity for Algorand-based assets. Exchanges and trading platforms often hesitate to list assets that may be classified as securities due to regulatory concerns. By leveraging the Compliance AI software to engineer digital assets for compliance with securities regulations, asset creators can enhance the likelihood of their assets being listed on reputable exchanges, thus increasing market liquidity and accessibility for investors. This, in turn, can attract more capital and liquidity to the Algorand ecosystem, fueling innovation and ecosystem development.

Strengthened Reputation and Trust: Supporting the Choice Coin Compliance AI proposal can strengthen the reputation and trustworthiness of the Algorand blockchain as a compliant and reputable platform for digital asset issuance and trading. By providing asset creators with transparent and reliable compliance solutions, Algorand demonstrates its commitment to regulatory compliance and investor protection. This proactive approach not only mitigates legal and regulatory risks for Algorand-based projects but also builds trust and confidence among investors, users, and regulatory authorities. As a result, the Algorand community can attract more high-quality projects, partnerships, and investments, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform for innovative solutions and responsible growth.

Overall, funding the Choice Coin Compliance AI proposal can bring significant benefits to the Algorand community, including enhanced regulatory compliance, increased market access and liquidity, and strengthened reputation and trust. These benefits contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the Algorand ecosystem, driving broader adoption, innovation, and ecosystem growth.
