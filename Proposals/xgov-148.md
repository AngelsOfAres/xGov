## Abstract

So you’ve found the next 100x coin, your excited! You bought some yesterday and you bought some today - but the price changed in that time - green candles of course! - but how does that affect your return? What’s your average buying price? What happened in between your buys, what was the volume?

Coin Tracker+ is another innovative feature brought to you by CompX. Analytics are great but personalised analytics are even better. Select any coin/token/ASA/NFT and get a personalised dashboard related to your holdings, buying, selling, average prices and overall P+L. Find farming/staking opportunities to your holdings and get alerts on price changes.
