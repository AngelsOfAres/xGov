## Abstract
The Toy Collectibles market was estimated at 13bilion in 2022 and is estimated to grow to 25bilion by 2025. It is rapidly growing market that is also a great match to combine with NFT technology.

If succesfully funded we are partnering with an established player in the collectible toy industry that holds singinficant brand IPs for action toys that are also a perfect fit for our mobile game (imagine transformers or gundam mobile suit IP being added to Cosmic Champs game).

We will do a limited physical run of a known collectible toy (not a cosmic champs character) and integrate it in our game as NFT. Each figurine will have its NFT counterpart. We will work on establishing a behaviour driven distribution channel, that will open Algorand to a whole new audience of collectors to interact ecosystem and pave the road for near future when industry behemots like Disney or Marvel will be looking for the blockchain to offer ther products as NFT + physicial collectibles.

We see huge potential to onboard new community and also to establish the narrative that Algorand is the best chain for phigital (physical + digital) products. At the same time we do acknowledge that the costs of such endeavours are quite high and it is not possible to do it on our own budget.

## Team
Cosmic champs team : <a href="https://cosmicchamps.com/#team" target="_blank">https://cosmicchamps.com/#team</a>
Our partner is a well established and long-time present entity in posession of multiple IPs in the collectible toys market. They have significant experience with sourcing manufacturing and distributing physical collectibles worldwide.

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

Our partner is new to Algorand and they are looking to do a pilot with a trusted and established project in the space that can ensure that their part(nft + game integration) will be done without issues. Cosmic Champs fits that description perfectly!

## Present Proposal
We will launch a physical toy + NFT campaign with an established IP in the collectible world. Together with our partner we will produce a limited physical run of known action figurine, that will each be tied to an algorand NFT that will also be integrated with our mobile game. The figurine+nft pairs will be sold and distributed via online stores of our partner, in person on collectable/comics conventions, and via algorand NFT markets.

We will explore options on how to best incentivize and guide new audience (toy collectors) to engage with Algorand ecosystem and be rewarded for it with oppurtunity of the value they percieve high(limited collectible). For an example we could run a campaign to encourage new users to interact with Algorand through dedicates channels and earn a chance to buy this limited run collectible toy. This way we can ensure higher conversion rate of this new audience than what would be otherwise possible if we simply sold NFTs and Toys.

Basically we will do what nextg3nz failed to do, but efficiently, organically with actual positive impact on Algorand and user onboarding, and for a lot less funds and with high certainty! Our and our partners combined experience has all parts of the process covered. Further more the collectible physical toys + game nfts are a lot more natural and "sane" combination of the Real world Asset and virtual good and are something we are cofident will become a very popular trend in near future. Each party involved in thsi process has shown in the past they can deliver on their part of the proejct, so we have high confidence of delivering on time and with highest quality of execution.

We request 100% of the funds paid up front, as we need to pay for the production of a minimum inventory of toys in advance. Print on demand options are not viable, if we wish to ensure quality and no delays with shipping and distribution of the physical toy.
Both our partner and our team are putting significant costs towards this effort, the grant is mostly to help cover the costs of the production of the pysical toys.

deliverables are:
- 3d character of the collectible toy added to Cosmic Champs game
- a small limited run of physical collectible toys manufactured
- NFTs minted for each of the manufactured figurines

We are looking to wrap up the project within 3-6 months of the funding received.


## Future Blueprint
In the future we are looking to bringing more IPs from the collectible world and their wast audiences to algorand.

## Benefits for the community
Doing this successfully will further position Algorand as the best chain for RWA. This will open Algorand to a whole new audience and pave the road for near future when industry behemots like Disney or Marvel will be looking for the blockchain to offer their products in NFT+phyisical  combination.
We will also show that phisical item + NFT can actualyl be exciting novelty and show that it can be done on algorand efficienty, professionally and in timely manner.
