## Abstract
Develop a "match-2" open-source browser game with scoring to explore algorand NFT collections. It provides a very visual and engaging experience of discovering Algorand NFT scene. It can be used as a tool for giveaways and competitions to cheaply and easily drive extra activity to the projects. In the future we would like to expand this to become a crosschain platform to help with onboarding new NFT enthusiast to Algorand. You can try a POC version here: <a href="https://cosmic-match.vercel.app" target="_blank">https://cosmic-match.vercel.app</a>

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from. Try the MVP version of the game here:  <a href="https://cosmic-match.vercel.app" target="_blank">https://cosmic-match.vercel.app</a>

## Present Proposal
This open-source browser "match-2/memory" game will be available for use to anyone in the Algorand community. It is a fun way to ENGAGE a community and to SHOWCASE an NFT collection or a collection of NFTs from different projects (you can fill the tiles with your own NFTs, or randomly with NFTs from different NFT collections). It also adds additional UTILITY to an NFT collection as it allows projects to host competitions for their community, run promotional giveaways, or just to flex their superior art. It is a very low-effort, low-cost to bring extra exposure to NFT collections or to activate existing community of individual projects. We will maintain the platform for at-least 6 months and rotate “spotlight” collections, but as it’s also open-sourced other projects or community will be able to deploy their own version with the customizations they require. We've developed a POC version of the game to showcase our ability to deliver, but there are still lots of elements that need to be integrated such as wallet integration, streamlining a way for NFT collections to be added to the platform, sort how NFTs are populated in the game depending if they are in your wallet and if they are in integrated collections, ensure server siide/db data handling e.g. anti-hack measures. It’s important this game is secure, if it is to be used for giveaways and competitions.

We are asking for 100% of the funds in advance as we've already invested resources in building the POC and we would like to compensate our team for the work they spend on this project going forward.
We plan to finish the proejct in less than 3 months after funding is received.
Source code will be available on github.

## Future Blueprint
The platform has huge potential for future development by going cross chain, so it can engage wider blockchain NFT community. It can we updated by adding s simple self-hosted competition/giveaways options for proejcts to gain exposure and to engage new communities.

## Benefits for the community
It is a fun way to ENGAGE a community and to SHOWCASE an NFT collection or a collection of NFTs from different projects. It also adds additional UTILITY to any NFT collection as it allows projects to host competitions with their NFT collections, run promotional giveaways, or just to flex their superior art in specific collections. It’s also open-sourced anyone will be able to deploy their own version with the customizations they require. In the future it can be expanded to support multiple chains, end thus enabling onbloarding new communities.
