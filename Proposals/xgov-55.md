## Abstract
Plausible (Proof of anything protocol) is known to Algorand ecosystem and already finished AXL Ventures pre-seed accelerator, and getting ready to go for profitability and growth

but given the bear market conditions the GoPlausible team needs some runway to make it there which we hope can be achieved through the XGOV initiative!

## Team
GoPlausible is built by a lean agile and effective engineering team consisting of a husband and wife with decades  of experience in different software engineering enterprise domains (Banking, Payments, Auto manufacturing industries, Telecom,  Oil & Gas,...). 

MG: technology architect, in charge of the backend, data, ASCs, ABIs, and APIs

Sheghzo: frontend engineer, in charge of frontend, data delivery, and WebAPIs


## Experience with Algorand
Being focused on Algorand since 2020 gave the team members a good track record of technology awareness, contributions, and collaboration with the Algorand ecosystem!

Open source tools, bridge projects, pioneering tech features, direct contributions in code bases. plus collaboration with many ecosystem projects and contributors are all among the GoPlausible team's experience and journey with Algorand so far!

## Present Proposal
This milestone-based roadmap has 2 phases, both covered with the requested amount:

### Phase 1
Date: 01/11/2023
Description: Algorand ---> POLYGON & BSC for claiming PLAUS
- Add dynamic NFT bridge functionality with metadata converter (ARC3 to ERC1155)
- Add UI elements and controls (ENABLE MULTICHAIN switch and chain select plus WalletConnect2 for EVM wallets to claim!)
- Add smart contract additions: PLAUS item smart contract to be added vault functionality! Complete solidity contracts for the EVM side of the NFT bridge
- 
### Phase 2
Date: 15/11/2023
Description: POLYGON & BSC ---> Algorand for creating PLAUS
- Accepting POLYGON & BSC supporting wallets via WalletConnect2 protocol to onboard to GoPlausible on Algorand (because even on multichain scenarios all logic stays on Algorand)
- Extending the dynamic NFT bridge for POLYGON & BSC ---> Algorand! Extending metadata converter to support ERC1155----> ARC3 (this bridge functionalities will be only operational for GoPlausible during this milestone
- Adding internal vault and lock/release mechanism for ETH, BNB, and Algo 
- Integrating Goracle for ETH, BNB, and Algo realtime pair prices

## Benefits for the community
- Outreach of Algorand PLAUS scenarios to POLYGON, BSC (and many other EVM in continuance)
- Absorbing a fair share of transactions, users, and funds from EVM chains into Algorand 
- Big jump in the total number of active wallets for Algorand
- Big jump in the average count of NFTs per wallet for Algorand
  
## Additional information
The NFT bridge to be released and deployed as a public service plus open-sourcing its entire source code is among first priorities after phase 2!
So as an added value to helping GoPlauisble as an ecosystem fundamental utility service grow, this XGOV grant, if voted in, can give birth to the FOSS service of Dynamic NFT bridge between Algorand and EVM!

Important note: The NFT bridge has been publicly requested by GoPlausible for months now and this has been asked from major bridge providers frequently (Messina one, London bridge,...) but it seems it is not on the priority agenda list for any vendor currently (probably some will pop with idea after this proposal!!) so the GoPlausible team is going to do it the usual way and build what is required!
