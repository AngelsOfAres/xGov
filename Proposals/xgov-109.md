## Abstract
We'll be unraveling the landscape of Real-World Assets tokenized on Algorand. Showing web2 and web3 consumers that Algorand is 'the' blockchain best suited for RWA (using actual on-chain data). Made by Chaintrail, a blockchain intelligence & insights platform focussed on uncovering Algorand in full (Dapp impact, NFT's, RWA, Network insights, TVL, Stables, ...)
 
## Team
Founded by Leander (@nfnomad). 15+ years of experience in building (mobile) apps and e-commerce platforms. ~9 years of it as tech-exec for 2 separate startups leading product & tech. One scaled towards 300+ employees (100 in tech & product). At the moment solely focussed on building chaintrail.

## Experience with Algorand
Involved in Algorand blockchain since early 2021 (mostly as a user). Experimented with multiple Algorand SDK's and build several test projects to test out the waters on how Algorand works.

Furthermore tracking lots of projects in the ecosystem. However, I noticed a platform was missing in the ecosystem where it was all brought together and truly uncover the value that Algorand blockchain contains. Therefore decided to build Chaintrail in order to uncover such value.

## Present Proposal
This proposal is a continuance of our previous proposal from Q4 2023 (#61). For next quarter we want to:

Show why Algorand is *the* RWA blockchain
uncovering the true RWA (Real World Assets) value of almost all that is currently tokenized on Algorand blockchain: 
- New segment with real-time insights of what is tokenized and the monetairy value of it (think Lofty, Agrotoken, Anote Music, TravelX and many more). Similar to our NFT section.
- Daily, weekly and monthly tokenization volume & trendlines.
- Insights on total tokenized volume over-time

Improve performance
Ensure Chaintrail can keep up with the increased adoption happening on Algorand. This will be critical to make sure chaintrail can be your most trusted Algorand intelligence platform that you can rely on for real-time data intelligence, no matter how high the TPS. 

- Rewrite our data ingestion engine in Node.JS to match transactions concurrently. 
- Improve our data matching algorithms 

Explorer (historic)
Starting to support historic data for block rounds & transactions
- Being able to identify what happened in any block processed on chain (not only the last 48 hours). 
- Being able to always understand and verify where a transaction came from and what it is (any transaction that happened on-chain, if Chaintrail can source it).

Show on-chain DEX Swaps
Provide real-time and historic insights on DEX swaps on-chain.
- Show swaps that are happening real-time and through which DEX. 
- Daily, weekly and monthly volume & insights.
- Insights on the popularity of each DEX based on earnings and volumes. 

General improvements
Above is a clear roadmap of the new insights we will develop and launch in Q1 2024. However, our product is constantly improved with new opportunities that pop-up as they happen (e.g. a new impactful dapp launches). Expect more general product improvements, extra coverage and other features that are not listed above. But deemed part of this xGov grant. 

Did you know that Chaintrail is proudly supported by over 54 dedicated community members, each investing just $2.5 per month? And that number keeps growing every week! ðŸš€ Chaintrail is not profitable yet, but we have a plan to get there in the coming year(s).


## Future Blueprint
As set out in the abstract. Chaintrail is set to uncover all the great things that are currenctly developed and driving real-world impact using Algorand at the foundation.

I started this project as I noticed a lack of insights of what was really driving on-chain impact and whether this was increasing or not. Given there were no such platforms out there, I decided to build one my own.
In the months/years to come, I'd like to ensure that Chaintrail can be used to understand any transaction that happens on-chain. Linking it back to certain projects and drilldown into such project to understand what progress they've made over time in terms of growth. 

This could help you make better investment decisions or simply get to see how certain categories are growing to potentially build something yourself.

With the Chaintrail API we plan to work together with other aggregators that currently don't cover Algorand very well. For instance many multi-chain aggregators are listing the wrong NFT value, incomplete TVL or RWA. 

Chaintrail is set to change that.

## Benefits for the community
We're the only blockchain insights project that's focussed on one single blockchain: Algorand. This gives us the advantage that we can move a lot quicker and uncover data that hasn't been uncovered before. We did this already with NFT sales from TravelX & Fifa+ Collect, but also Agrotoken, Exodus their EXIT shares, Anote Music and many more in the near future.

Our Dapps Activity (which is the fundament of Chaintrail) shows many insights to any Algorand follower of what's really driving on-chain traction/impact. Think of projects like: Hesab Pay, Fracctal Monsters, the weekly share of PlanetWatch and more.

This all benefits the community in terms of insights, knowing how Algorand is doing as an ecosystem. But also makes it easy to uncover new projects that you might not have seen before.

## Additional information
We're on a mission to uncover the entire Algorand ecosystem for you. But we need your help! The grant we're seeking is a push in the right direction. The funding will be used to fund our new features, enhance our coverage and support on our infrastructure growth costs.

As the Algorand blockchain evolves, we're committed to providing you with a high-performing platform. That's why we're planning to submit xGov proposals every quarter, taking small but meaningful steps towards our vision.

We published our current revenue stream (the amount of memberships sold) here: https://chaintrail.io/revenue. This will remain our long-term focus to ensure we built a healthy project that can sustain itself in the future.
