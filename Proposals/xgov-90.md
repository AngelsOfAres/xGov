## Abstract
We will build payment scheduler integrated to A-Wallet. Payment scheduler will be able to do periodic DEX aggregator swaps, direct payments and it will also have conditional execution. For example if the oracle price is lower than X, swap Y amount of tokens.

## Present Proposal
We will build payment scheduler integrated to A-Wallet. Payment scheduler will be able to do periodic DEX aggregator swaps, direct payments and it will also have conditional execution. For example if the oracle price is lower than X, swap Y amount of tokens.

Feature will utilize multisig escrow accounts where one account will be owned by user and second by server. User can easily withdraw from the escrow account funds by any wallet supporting algorand native multisig feature.

This is going to be paid service. Each execution of worker will first deduct the fee from the escrow account.

## Benefits for the community

- More bank friendly algorand accounts
- Reccuring payments are needed in the algorand ecosystem
