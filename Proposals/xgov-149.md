## Abstract

AT CompX we pride ourselves on bringing innovative solutions to the Algorand DeFi ecosystem. Our auto-compounding farms give users new strategies to earn higher yield in a more efficient manner. To further enhance our auto-compounding farm product we want to introduce a mechanism where users can yield additional rewards on top of the farm APR and the auto-compounding bonus.

## Present Proposal

We propose to create a mechanism that gives CompX the ability to add targeted rewards to our auto-compounding farms and rewarding users with additional yield if they hold their position in that farm for a specified amount of time. However, these lock up periods are not mandatory and users can exit their positions at any time however they will forfeit an amount of their additional rewards based on the time left in the lock-up period for the farm position.

Development plan
> Creation of reward payout mechanism tied to function of users time within a farm position
> Front-end changes to allow for review of additional rewards and lock up periods
> Update to back end databases to allow for multiple farms of the same type with different lock up period to allow more diverse strategies for users.
> Test on staging via testnet to gather feedback and implement further changes if necessary.
> Smart Contract audit


## Benefits for the community

Giving the community different avenues to gain further yield on their tokens empowers users with more options and strategies for their DeFi. Additionally incentivising our auto-compounding farms leads to additional transaction volume for Algorand blockchain as a whole.
