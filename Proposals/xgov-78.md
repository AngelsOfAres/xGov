## Abstract
Expand on the current Evil Tools toolset and turn it into a wallet browser that is capable of Bulk Functions. This would create a UI for collectors and creators where they can simply select assets vs having to gather their ASA IDs to perform bulk functions. 

Evil Tools has developed a slew of no-code tools to carry out monotonous processes on the Algorand Blockchain and allowing users with no coding experience to work efficiently and easily. To date, we are the leading no-code tooling provider for the chain and have built a suite of no-code tools for functions like opting in/out, sending, freezing, clawing back, minting, and updating metadata. We also have search tools that allow for people to view holdings for a wallet, find holders of 1/1 and Multi-Mint NFTs. 

All of these tools are open sourced. 

## Team
LoafPickle - Project Manager. I have 10 years of Project Management experience working in NYC on large scale construction projects. In addition, I am a long timer in the Algorand NFT Space and have been helping develop utility projects on the chain since May 2021. I am currently the Head of Strategy and Community for Thurstober Digital Studios. 

ByKewel - Tool Developer. Kewel is another Algorand NFT long timer that was the first to create wallet holding, sales, and listing discord bots that projects were able to incorporate into the ecosysytem. They also built the first on-chain DAO tool back in February 2022.

## Experience with Algorand
All of us have been in the Algorand NFT Space since May 2021. Thurstober Digital Studios has built a full horse racing utility series and our body of work with Evil Tools speaks for itself.

## Present Proposal
ByKewel had already built Codex, which was an NFT browser. The goal is to combine that with the bulk tooling that we currently offer and allow users to select a multitude of assets and be able to do things like Send or Opt Out efficiently and easily. 

The goal is to create a structure that is similar to what randgallery has in terms of Asset Viewing, but build in the bulk processes to create a better user interface for creators and collectors. 

-----------------------------

General Layout: Have a wallet viewer that can be filtered by creator wallet, asset id, newest first, and oldest first. For creator wallets, if linked to an NFD, the wallets will be lumped and labeled accordingly with a link to the directory. 

On the bottom of the page there will be a section where opted in assets, but not displayed will be shown.

Selecting assets: You can select up to 64 assets (32 if using destroy tool) and there will be buttons for mass opt in, mass opt out, mass send, transfer, or mass destroy. 

When sorted by creator wallet, one has the option to select all for easy convenience. Same for the opted in only assets for easy opt out. 


## Future Blueprint
Build it. 

## Benefits for the community
The benefits are already being realized. When the myalgo hack went down, we quickly created mass add and send tools with Pera integration so creators and collectors alike were able to efficiently move their assets to safe homes. Since then, we have creators thanking us for providing them the tools we wish we had back in the early days of Algorand NFTs.

## Additional information
We had been approved in the first xGov Round to build more tools. The tools have since been completed and made open source.

In addition to the tooling, we also provide creator guides that allow new creators to get a lay of the ecosystem to help the onboarding experience. You can find them here: https://medium.com/@loafpickle
