## Abstract
With 2024 being an election year in the United States, voting security has never been a hotter or more important topic. Algorand has unique features that have allowed several voting technologies to be invented, which provide an order of magnitude improvement over tradition voting machines and paper ballots. This research seeks to explain the basis for these different voting technologies and explore potential avenues for scalable adoption in elections. This is important because voting is a real use case, where Algorand provides a huge advantage in cost, performance, and efficiency to legacy systems.

## Present Proposal
A detailed plan for the development and implementation of the proposal.

To enhance clarity and accountability, we're asking proposers to detail the maintenance period, availability, and sustainability plans for their projects. This includes information on potential costs and the duration for which services will be offered at no or reduced cost

### Deliverable
Proposals must include clear, non-technical descriptions of deliverables. We encourage the use of multimedia (blog/video) to help explain your proposal's benefits to the community. 

Proposals that do not specify deliverables and a process to check deliverables will be rejected.

## Future Blueprint
> This part can be optional for one-time grants.
A high-level plan, defining an overarching strategic objective and capturing the major steps planned for achieving the project at a greater scale.
