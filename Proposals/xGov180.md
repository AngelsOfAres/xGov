## Abstract
With 2024 being an election year in the United States, voting security has never been a hotter or more important topic. Algorand has unique features that have allowed several voting technologies to be invented, which provide an order of magnitude improvement over traditional voting machines and paper ballots. This research seeks to explain the basis for these different voting technologies and explore potential avenues for scalable adoption of Algorand in election voting. This is important because voting is a real use case, where Algorand provides a huge advantage in cost, performance, and efficiency to legacy systems.

## Present Proposal
- Research. (2 weeks) Collecting data, articles, and information relating to voting technologies and Algorand.
- Outling. (1 week) Outlining the articles substance and identifying particular points and topics.
- Drafting. (2 weeks) Writing the article.
- Finalizing. (1 week) Reviewing, revising, and publishing the article.

### Deliverable
The deliverable will be a research article of at least 7,500 words with at least 75 sources. The article will be published in an open source database and on GitHub. 

## Benefits for the community
Increased Adoption: Scalable adoption of Algorand-based voting technologies in elections could serve as a powerful use case showcasing the capabilities of the Algorand blockchain. As governments and organizations witness the benefits of using Algorand for voting, there could be increased interest in adopting Algorand for other applications, such as supply chain management, identity verification, and financial transactions. This expanded adoption could lead to a larger user base and ecosystem growth for Algorand.

Community Engagement: The proposal's focus on voting security aligns with the values of transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization that are central to the Algorand community. By actively contributing to research aimed at improving democratic processes through technology, the Algorand community can foster greater engagement and participation among its members. Furthermore, involving the community in discussions and experiments related to voting technologies can generate valuable insights and feedback for further refining Algorand's capabilities.

Global Impact: The research outcomes have the potential to influence not only the Algorand community but also the broader global community interested in voting security and blockchain technology. By demonstrating the effectiveness of Algorand-based solutions in real-world scenarios, the proposal could inspire governments, electoral commissions, and organizations worldwide to consider adopting similar approaches to enhance the integrity and accessibility of their voting systems. This could lead to a positive impact on democracy, governance, and societal trust on a global scale.

Economic Opportunities: As Algorand gains recognition as a leading platform for secure and efficient voting systems, it could create economic opportunities for developers, entrepreneurs, and businesses specializing in blockchain-based solutions. The demand for skilled professionals and innovative products and services in the Algorand ecosystem could increase, leading to job creation, investment opportunities, and economic growth.
